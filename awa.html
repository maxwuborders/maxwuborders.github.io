                <div class="col-md-10 col-lg-8 col-xl-7">
                    <p>Have you ever wondered how it feels to be a stranger to your own country? This was Awa’s response
                        when asked if he felt “at home” in Costa Rica. Awa is a member of the Bribri, an indigenous
                        tribe native to Costa Rica’s Talamanca mountain range. The Bribri are an autochthonous group to
                        Costa Rican mountain ranges, having established their territories long before the Spanish
                        Conquista. Throughout the centuries, they have lost their ancestral land to development and
                        modernization. Today, the Bribri tribe’s territory is just a small fraction of what it once was.
                        Moreover, due to increased globalization and urbanization, they are facing an unprecedented
                        crisis - the loss of identity and culture.
                    </p>
                    <p>Awa’s village is neglected by the authorities, and they live in extreme poverty without much aid.
                        The borders that define their native community, rather than being a guardian of their unique
                        identities, ways of life, and culture, are instead used to subvert responsibility by the
                        government by the guise of “autonomy”. These boundaries serve only to benefit the people in
                        government - if any part of their land is home to precious resources or simply needed to expand
                        domestic agriculture, the borders are suddenly quite fluid. Apparently, they are suddenly told
                        that they are the same as all Costa Ricans and entitled to the benefits of development.
                        According to Awa, this is almost always a lie. The Bribri rarely see the flow of money into
                        their communities, and instead the profits flow directly to San Jose. And even if people like
                        Awa want to work, due to the racial discrimination that natives face in the eyes of Costa Rican
                        employers, they are passed on for these new jobs and unemployment remains a critical issue. On
                        the other hand, when issues arise for the village, these borders are suddenly very firm, and the
                        Bribri are once again considered an independent citizenry that the government respects their
                        duty to be left autonomous.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">No place to call home</h2>

                    <p>Awa tells me he was unemployed, and like many other young people from his tribe he migrated out
                        of his village to look for work and a livelihood. However, the playing field is not level for
                        indigenous people in Costa Rica. Outside of his community he continues to face discrimination in
                        the job market, and is only able to work odd jobs relying on physical labor that other Costa
                        Ricans would rather not do. It was clear that this division that people have drawn between the
                        Bribri and everyone else gave the justification of abuse and discrimination to people that on
                        paper should be unified and living harmoniously in the same nation. At the same time, Awa
                        clarifies that he does not place all the blame on the people outside his village, but there is
                        no denying that his experience has been very discouraging. He painted a very grim picture for
                        those searching for employment outside the tribe - either they are so abused and mistreated by
                        the outsiders that they crawl back home, where they are ridiculed for their arrogance and lack
                        of appreciation for the tribe, or if they are resilient enough to make it in the outside world,
                        they are regarded as traitors that have forsaken our culture in exchange for colones. Colones
                        were named after Christopher Columbus after all.
                    </p>
                    <p>Therefore, people like Awa are subsequently shunned by their communities and “the only people
                        that understand and can relate to them in this world”. Nonetheless, Awa states that this is to
                        be expected:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">“They are not entirely wrong, not in their discrimination towards
                        people only hoping to live a better life, but in the loss of our culture and language. When we
                        are so mistreated for our origins, it is only the natural step that we attempt to remove
                        ourselves from our own culture and traditions so that we may better fit in with the new outside
                        world. And because of the backlash that we face should we return home, many such as myself have
                        resigned ourselves to living out the rest of my life outside of where I was born.”
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>In this way these insidious borders force those who may have developed skills or acquired useful
                        resources outside of the tribe to be prevented from bringing them back in.
                    </p>
                    <p>Awa made it clear that these borders between the tribe and the outside do little to help them -
                        they are meant to contain the suffering and hardships inside, while preventing prosperity or
                        fortune from coming in. Even then, he tells me he wishes to return home to his village one day.
