                    <p>Physical borders are not the only barriers that separate people in Costa Rica. In this
                        increasingly globalized world, due to the advent of technology, digital borders have become
                        commonplace as well. Over the past few years, call centers have been popping up at alarming
                        numbers in San José. Promising job security and stability in a country facing an employment
                        crisis, they have become very popular with the Costa Rican youth. However, as I have come to
                        learn from multiple accounts, they are not as great as they would like you to believe.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">A digital border</h2>
                    <p>Jorge is a call center worker in the capital city of San José. He has a bachelor’s and master’s
                        degree in Computer Science, and comes from a middle class family. While he considers himself
                        lucky for the opportunities he has had in life, he tells me that he is not reaching his full
                        potential. Being university educated in computer science, he had hoped that he would be able to
                        use his skills and knowledge to contribute to the development of Costa Rica, but software
                        engineering jobs are quite scarce in the country. According to Jorge, there is an oversupply of
                        computer science graduates in Costa Rica, and beyond leaving the country and finding
                        opportunities elsewhere, new graduates such as himself end up underemployed and working in
                        fields where their knowledge is not necessary. He had hoped that completing a master’s degree
                        could give him the edge he needed to get hired, but this was not the case.
                    </p>
                    <p>Being also well versed in the English language, he was finally able to get a job at a call center
                        taking customer service calls from customers of American companies. However, even with his
                        language skills, working conditions are rough and the pay is subpar. The hours are long, and the
                        office does not provide much comfort. The managers are taskmasters and attempt to ensure that
                        every second at the company is being used to provide value to the company’s benefactors and
                        making money for a corporate entity - the workers are being milked dry. As Jorge states:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">“Rather than a job where my unique skills could be valued, I am
                        reminded constantly by the company management that by all measures I am unremarkable and easily
                        replaced at any time. Furthering that, they see it as motivation for me to work even harder to
                        keep my job. The attitudes of the customers do not help, and likely exasperate the belittlement
                        that us workers face from management. When there are issues with the parent company that I am
                        not in control of, or the need to access information or functions that our company has simply
                        not provided or relayed to us, racial insults and discrimination are often fallbacks.”
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Additionally, customers are also often a problem. Jorge mentions he is often disparaged for his
                        English abilities, and customers say they would rather “speak to an American” at the first
                        opportunity. This dismissive attitude is not lost on the management, and both compound together
                        to create a hostile work environment. According to Jorge, customers dismiss the value they
                        provide, leading management to further neglect and regard them with disposability, reducing the
                        resources and training provided to them, and thus affecting the quality and effectiveness of the
                        work they can deliver. However, Jorge is convinced that such attitudes and conditions cannot
                        solely be blamed on the individuals that he has interacted with. He mentions that if he were
                        working in the US, not only would he potentially find a job that would better be suited to the
                        skills he worked so hard to acquire, but he would also be treated with far less dismissal. It is
                        interesting to see that even as hard borders fall away through our modern forms of communication
                        such as the internet and cell phones, they continue to cast a long shadow over our interactions
                        with each other and our lives.
                    </p>
                    <p>After all, when Jorge is at work, he is not serving his community, nor providing assistance to
                        the
                        people he knows. Instead he is facilitating the functions and economy of a foreign land, and by
                        all means contributing to the betterment of livelihoods there. However because of the borders
                        that divide us, he is shut out of the rewards of such work. Even in the non-physical world, a
                        digital border affects the perceptions and interactions he has with individuals on the other
                        side. While the circumstances that divide Costa Rica from the US are numerous and challenging to
                        connect, one would have hoped that through a medium where the distances feel so much shorter
                        that the impact of borders between peoples would be diminished. It is instead evident that the
                        lines we use to divide peoples stretch beyond any map, into the physical world, and into the
                        digital one.
